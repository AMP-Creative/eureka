        description: "The moment is tense, and baffling. You look at each other with surprise, hurt, and disappointment. How did this misunderstanding occur? How did you end up at such cross-purposes? What planet is this person from, anyway?!? Unfortunately, some of us have found ourselves in this situation. Maybe it occurred over a video call with a colleague, in a Zoom with family, or during a recent shelter-in-place moment in your household. From the Covid-19 pandemic to the Black Lives Matter movement, 2020 has been a challenging year. But these challenges have some people on the path to learning about, advocating for, and standing with perspectives that are not their own. Others are standing in opposition, holding opposing viewpoints that are dividing our country and pitting groups against each other. What causes some people to seek consensus, understanding, and collaboration, while others become even more entrenched in the status quo? How might people, despite differences in experience, thought, and action, find common ground and build solutions that are mutually beneficial? We need to learn how to understand the perspectives of others. Others view us differently than we view ourselves, and our shared circumstances don’t result in shared conclusions. However, our goals still have equal value. To understand this, we need to engage in perspective taking.",

        description: "When scientists learn better communication skills, they not only convey their research to a broader audience but also become better connected to their own scientific communities. Communication skills are among the most important skills we can provide for new scientists; they enable better networking, collaborating, teaching, and leading. These skills will serve a scientist, and the scientific community at large, throughout the scientist’s entire career. Although the primary goal of science communication training is to improve a scientist’s ability to communicate with the public and research peers, the potential of this training to provide a sense of community and self-awareness is of equal importance. We believe that science communication training sessions or programs (trainings), designed with these additional goals in mind, can benefit a department, school, program, or meeting in addition to benefiting the individual participants.",

Finally, integrating lessons from the literature with my own experience of developing and implementing a new innovation training model (CLEAR IDEAS) for organisations, the chapter will conclude with a set of practical guidelines on what makes for more effective creativity training interventions.",

Most of us are surrounded by people who look like us, vote like us, earn like us, spend money like us, have educations like us and worship like us. The result is an empathy deficit, and it’s at the root of many of our biggest problems. It’s because of how homogeneous people’s social circles have become, and also because humans naturally hold biases. But researchers have discovered that far from being an immutable trait, empathy can be developed. There are steps people can take to acknowledge their biases and to move beyond their own worldviews to try to understand those held by other people. Bonus: You’ll make new friends along the way.",

        description: "Computer programming is the process of writing instructions that get executed by computers. The instructions, also known as code, are written in a programming language which the computer can understand and use to perform a task or solve a problem. Basic computer programming involves the analysis of a problem and development of a logical sequence of instructions to solve it. There can be numerous paths to a solution and the computer programmer seeks to design and code that which is most efficient. Among the programmer’s tasks are understanding requirements, determining the right programming language to use, designing or architecting the solution, coding, testing, debugging and writing documentation so that the solution can be easily understood by other programmers. Computer programming is at the heart of computer science. It is the implementation portion of software development, application development and software engineering efforts, transforming ideas and theories into actual, working solutions.",
